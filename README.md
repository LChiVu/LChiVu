ðŸ“Š A little back story, I actually started my Data Analytics major at Denison Univerisy as a junior - yes, my DA101 class was in the fall semester my third year in college. Despite being so far behind from my peers, and so completely out of my comfort zone, I ended up receiving the Practitioner of the Practice Award from the department. Throughout the process, I embodied "the Data Analytics process - an interative cycle that requires curiosity, resilience, and collaboration in order to success." Hopefully my projects below shows you just that.
